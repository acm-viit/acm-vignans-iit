            <br />

            <p>Vignan's IIT ACM student chapter is organizing a Workshop on GitHub and a comprehensive guide to common LinkedIn profile building questions.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Well, you might have heard the word GitHub in your tech space or even stumbled across a GitHub repository while learning about software or web development. Still, GitHub can seem perplexing if you've never used it. Is it a cloud storage site? A social networking site for programmers? A code-sharing site? As it turns out, the answer to all of these is yes, and more.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Today, GitHub is one of the most popular resources for developers to share code and work on projects together. It's free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software. If this all sounds like something you should know then don't miss our event on 23rd April, 2022. We'll explain what GitHub is, why it's popular, how to get started, and, perhaps most importantly, what "Git" actually means.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Adding to it, we will give suggestions to craft the perfect LinkedIn profile which attracts the hiring team and makes you fly with high colors.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Happy coding!!!</p>

        description: `
            <p>The leading open-source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project. Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. Jenkins supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase, and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and sbt-based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Jenkins is written entirely in Java. It lets you execute a series of actions to achieve the continuous integration process, that too in an automated fashion.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>This CI server runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. Jenkins facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery in software projects by automating parts related to build, test, and deployment. This makes it easy for developers to continuously work on the betterment of the product by integrating changes to the project.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Jenkins automates the software builds in a continuous manner and lets the developers know about the errors at an early stage. A strong Jenkins community is one of the prime reasons for its popularity. Jenkins is not only extensible but also has a thriving plugin ecosystem.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Some of the possible steps that can be performed using Jenkins are:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Software build using build systems such as Gradle, Maven, and more.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Automation testing using test frameworks such as Nose2, PyTest, Robot, Selenium, and more.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Execute test scripts (using Windows terminal, Linux shell, etc).</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Achieve test results and perform post actions such as printing test reports, and more.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Execute test scenarios against different input combinations for obtaining improved test coverage.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Continuous Integration (CI) where the artifacts are automatically created and tested. This aids in the identification of issues in the product at an early stage of development.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            
            <p>At the time of what is Jenkins blog, it had close to 1500+ plugins contributed by the community. Plugins help in customizing the experience with Jenkins, along with providing support for accelerating activities related to building, deploying, and automating a project.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p>Jenkins is a community-driven project. We invite everyone to join the workshop and move it forward.</p>

            <br/>

            <p>Ethical Hacking 2.0 is a workshop conducted by Vignan's IIT, mentored by Lakshmi Narayana Degala, a Top 300 rank hacker on Intigriti.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>To be precise, Intigriti is Europe's #1 ethical hacking and bug bounty platform which works with teams of every size, shape, and industry to secure their digital assets, protect confidential information and customer data, and strengthen their responsible disclosure process. Working together on one target during a hacking event is great because everyone has their way of approaching the target and you can learn a lot!</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Students were tutored from the basics of securities till the end with practical knowledge. A good quality demonstration was provided to the students by the mentor on how things work in securities.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The topic involves ETHICAL HACKING with edge computing than ever before. This lecture covered the details of these concepts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>‚Ä¢ Cross-site scripting</strong></li>
                <li><strong>‚Ä¢ Brute forcing in panels and Parameters</strong></li>
                <li><strong>‚Ä¢ Subdomains and directories</strong></li>

            <br>
            In this Workshop, Students learned the basics of building Android apps with the Kotlin programming language. Along the way, thry develop a collection of apps to start there journey as an Android developer. And also learned about Git's core functionality so you can understand how and why it's used in organizations. We'll look into both basic and more advanced features, like branches and merging. We'll demonstrate how having a working knowledge of a VCS like Git can be a lifesaver in emergency situations or when debugging. And then you will explore how to use a VCS to work with others through remote repositories, like the ones provided by GitHub.

            <br>

            Students were really satisfied and took all the necessary advice on what are the loopholes and necessary areas that every student needs to take care while development
